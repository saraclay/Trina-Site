<h3>Prototyping</h3>
</div>

<p>
There are many tools (web-based and downloadable) on the Web in order to create wireframes and prototypes. Some create images and other create clickable prototypes by using hotspots to click an area on one screen to another screen. All of them have their own pros and cons, so use the tool that best fits your needs.

Sketches can provide a sense of the user experience as a whole and allow us to spot potential usability problems before we commit too much time to building the interface. So, grab a pencil.

<h3 id="wireframe">Wireframe Tools</h3>
</div>
<p>
A wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint, is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or screen of a mobile app. It is a low-fidelity visual representation of the layout of our app. The wireframe depicts the page layout or arrangement of the website's or app's content, including interface elements and navigational systems, and how they work together. The wireframe usually lacks typographic style, color, or graphics, since the main focus lies in functionality, behavior, and priority of content. In other words, it focuses on what a screen does, not what it looks like. Wireframes can be pencil drawings or sketches on a whiteboard, or they can be produced by means of a broad array of free or commercial software applications.
<br><br>
Since new ones are always being development, search for <strong>wireframe tools</strong> in your favorite web search engine.
